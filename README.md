# DAO Registration and Asset Tokenization Contracts

## Overview

This project contains Solidity smart contracts for DAO registration and asset tokenization. The contracts facilitate the creation of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) and tokenization of assets such as real estate properties, art collections, and intellectual properties. The project is bootstrapped with HardHat, a development environment for Ethereum.

## Contracts

### DAORegistration.sol

This contract manages the registration of DAOs and includes functionalities for:

+ DAO creation and configuration.
+ NFT issuance representing shares in the DAO.
+ Governance mechanisms for voting on DAO-related decisions.
+ Legal and regulatory compliance.
+ Dispute resolution.

### AssetTokenization.sol

This contract handles the tokenization of assets and provides features such as:

+ Asset description and tokenization process management.
+ Token creation using ERC721 or ERC1155 standards.
+ Compliance checks based on asset jurisdiction and legal framework.
+ Integration with DAOs for broader governance over the asset.

## Getting Started

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:

    ```solidity
    git clone <repository_url>
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    ```solidity
    cd <project_directory>
    npm install
    ```

3. Compile the contracts:

    ```solidity
    npx hardhat compile
    ```

4. Run tests (if available):

    ```solidity
    npx hardhat test
    ```

5. Deploy the contracts to the desired network (The below code allows you to deploy a local hardhat network (Similar to Ganache).):

    ```solidity
    npx hardhat ignition deploy ignition/modules/DAORegistration.ts --network localhost 
    ```

Replace <repository_url> with the URL of the repository and <project_directory> with the directory where you cloned the repository. Similarly, <network_name> should be replaced with the name of the Ethereum network you want to deploy to.

## Usage

Once deployed, the contracts can be interacted with using Ethereum wallets or through other smart contracts. Users can register DAOs, tokenize assets, issue tokens representing shares, and participate in governance activities.
